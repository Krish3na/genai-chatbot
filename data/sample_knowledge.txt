GenAI Chatbot Knowledge Base

This document contains information about the GenAI Chatbot project and its features.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
The GenAI Chatbot is a production-grade AI assistant built with OpenAI GPT-4 and LangChain. It features retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for enhanced knowledge access and intent classification for better query routing.

KEY FEATURES:
1. OpenAI GPT-4 Integration: The chatbot uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model for natural language processing and generation.

2. LangChain Framework: Built on LangChain for robust LLM application development with features like memory management and prompt templates.

3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): The system can access and search through document knowledge bases to provide more accurate and contextual responses.

4. Intent Classification: Advanced intent recognition to route different types of queries appropriately.

5. Multi-User Support: Handles conversations for multiple users with conversation history and memory.

6. Production Monitoring: Integrated with Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring latency, throughput, and model performance.

7. Containerization: Docker support for easy deployment and scaling.

8. Kubernetes Deployment: Production-ready deployment with Kubernetes manifests.

9. CI/CD Pipeline: Jenkins integration for automated testing and deployment.

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:
- Backend: FastAPI (Python web framework)
- LLM: OpenAI GPT-4
- Vector Database: ChromaDB for document embeddings
- Memory: ConversationBufferMemory for chat history
- Monitoring: Prometheus/Grafana
- Containerization: Docker
- Orchestration: Kubernetes
- CI/CD: Jenkins

DEPLOYMENT:
The chatbot can be deployed in multiple environments:
- Local development with Poetry
- Docker containers for consistent environments
- Kubernetes clusters for production scaling
- Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)

MONITORING AND OBSERVABILITY:
- Real-time metrics collection
- Performance monitoring
- Cost tracking for OpenAI API usage
- Error tracking and alerting
- User interaction analytics

This knowledge base helps the chatbot provide accurate information about its own capabilities and architecture.
